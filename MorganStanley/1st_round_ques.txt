Q.what are decorators
--Decorators solve 2 issues:
1)Code duplication
2)Cluttering main logic of function with additional functionality
common usecases::::
Checking argument type at runtime
Benchmark function calls
Cache function results
Count function calls
Checking metadata (permissions, roles, etc.)

--what are generators & iterators
Iterator in python is an object that is used to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. The iterator object is initialized using the iter() method. It uses the next() method for iteration.
When we use a for loop to traverse any iterable object, internally it uses the iter() method to get an iterator object which further uses next() method to iterate over. This method raises a StopIteration to signal the end of the iteration.

Generator is a special function in python that returns a generator object to the caller
A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
  
--what is lambda functions

--How yield is differant from return
yeild convets regular python function into generator
it replace the return of a function & suspend its execution without destroying local variables
Code written after yeild statement execute in next function call
Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don’t want to store the entire sequence in memory.

--what is differance between views and tables & when to use views
A view is a virtual table. A view consists of rows and columns just like a table. The difference between a view and a table is that views are definitions built on top of other tables (or views), and do not hold data themselves.If data is changing in the underlying table, the same change is reflected in the view. A view can be built on top of a single table or multiple tables. 
==> view actually retrive the data based on select statement when it is called
why use it?
1_data security
2_ease of use
3_space saving
View Do not have physical memory allocated for data but for schema it is.
but For materialized views(Indexed views) memory is allocated

Create view temp_view as
select col1, col2 from ABC;

 
--till when views are available for user
--what is differance between CTE and views
Views being a physical object on database (but does not store data physically) and can be used on multiple queries, thus provide flexibility and centralized approach. CTE, on the other hand are temporary and will be created when they are used; that's why they are called as inline view

--What are sql indexes
An index is a schema object. It is used by the server to speed up the retrieval of rows by using a pointer. It can reduce disk I/O(input/output) by using a rapid path access method to locate data quickly. An index helps to speed up select queries and where clauses, but it slows down data input, with the update and the insert statements. Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data.

Types of indexes:
1)Clustered
Clustred index defines order in which data is physically stored in table, as data can be sorted in only one way there can be only one clustred index on table .In SQL server primary key constraint auto-incrementally creates a clustred index on that table.
You can create Custom Clustred index
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_tblStudent_Gender_Score
ON student(gender ASC, total_score DESC)

As you can see above we have used 2 columns to create Clustered index it is also called as composite index.The above index first sorts all the records in the ascending order of the gender. If gender is same for two or more records, the records are sorted in the descending order of the values in their “total_score” column

2)Non-Clustered
Nonclustred index doesn't sort physical data on table in fact nonclustred index is stored at one place and table data is stored at other place.This allows More than one non-clustred index per table 
When a query is issued against a column on which the index is created, the database will first go to the index and look for the address of the corresponding row in the table. It will then go to that row address and fetch other column values. It is due to this additional step that non-clustered indexes are slower than clustered indexes.
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_tblStudent_Name
ON student(name ASC)

when to use clustred index?
--Since non-clustred index  are stored at seperate location than original table, non-clustred indexes consume additional disk space. if disk space is a problem use clustred index.
Clustered indexes are faster than non-clustered indexes since they don’t involve any extra lookup step.


CREATE INDEX index_1
 ON TABLE_NAME column;
